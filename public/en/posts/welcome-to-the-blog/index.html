Shortly after entering the field in a professional capacity, I discovered a passion for all aspects of cybersecurity, particularly reverse engineering and threat analysis/intelligence.

Cybersecurity is something I genuinely enjoy, both in my professional and recreational capacities. My goal with this blog is to help share that passion with other young cybersecurity enthusiasts and professionals. What content can you expect\rI spend a significant amount of my time participating in various CTFs and other cyber-based challenges; therefore, I will post all my writeups here. My skills have also progressed to the point where I am occasionally conducting original research, so any reports or information regarding that will be shared on this blog.\nTLDR;\nCTF Writeups HTB Sherlock Writeups Threat Research Guides on various topics for beginners How I see things..\rThe only things I enjoy as much as cybersecurity are teaching and sharing knowledge - both bring me tremendous joy. I’m using this blog as a platform to help educate others in our field. There has been ongoing discourse in the industry about “oversaturation,” particularly at the entry level. While I believe this concern has merit, a significant portion of entry-level candidates lack fundamental skills and a basic understanding of core technology principles. Rather than contributing to gatekeeping, I want to help bridge that knowledge gap. My goal is to break down complex security concepts, share practical research methods, and help others build the foundational understanding that will serve them throughout their careers.\n",

<p>My name is Collin; I often go by &ldquo;wagon&rdquo; online. I have been in tech since I was old enough to understand what it was, and I have been working professionally in the sector for almost six years now. Shortly after entering the field in a professional capacity, I discovered a passion for all aspects of cybersecurity, particularly reverse engineering and threat analysis/intelligence. I will be finishing my bachelor&rsquo;s degree this year and continuing to pursue a master&rsquo;s degree in engineering from the SANS Institute of Technology. Cybersecurity is something I genuinely enjoy, both in my professional and recreational capacities. My goal with this blog is to help share that passion with other young cybersecurity enthusiasts and professionals.  </p>

<p>I spend a significant amount of my time participating in various CTFs and other cyber-based challenges; therefore, I will post all my writeups here. My skills have also progressed to the point where I am occasionally conducting original research, so any reports or information regarding that will be shared on this blog.</p>
<p>TLDR;</p>
<ul>
<li>CTF Writeups</li>
<li>HTB Sherlock Writeups</li>
<li>Threat Research</li>
<li>Guides on various topics for beginners</li>
</ul>

<p>The only things I enjoy as much as cybersecurity are teaching and sharing knowledge - both bring me tremendous joy. I&rsquo;m using this blog as a platform to help educate others in our field.
There has been ongoing discourse in the industry about &ldquo;oversaturation,&rdquo; particularly at the entry level. While I believe this concern has merit, a significant portion of entry-level candidates lack fundamental skills and a basic understanding of core technology principles. Rather than contributing to gatekeeping, I want to help bridge that knowledge gap.
My goal is to break down complex security concepts, share practical research methods, and help others build the foundational understanding that will serve them throughout their careers.</p>
